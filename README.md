## 🤍: About Me
**I’m a college student working hard for my future. I might not have all the answers yet, but I’m always learning and growing. I don’t mind making mistakes because I see them as stepping stones to getting better. I appreciate honesty and real connections—if you're genuine, we’ll get along just fine. As they say, “If you’re not failing, you’re not trying hard enough.**
